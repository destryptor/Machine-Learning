The zip file contains a Jupyter Notebook named "P5_22CS10088.ipynb" that contains the code and markdown explaining each step. Along with it, there's the Dataset2 folder which contains the augmented and enhanced images. Feel free to take a look to see how the number of images has increased and how the images have been enhanced.

Steps to run the code:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook application.
2. Navigate to the directory where this README file is located (i.e. P5_22CS10088)
3. Open the ipynb file.
4. Press the run button on each cell to see how the code executes.

Note: k fold validation for k = 5 takes around 50 minutes due to approx. 9500 images.
